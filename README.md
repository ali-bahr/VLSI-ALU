# VLSI-ALU
## Overview: 
This repository contains the design and layout of various adders, multipliers, and a floating-point ALU using VLSI techniques.
The project encompasses the creation, simulation, synthesis, and physical layout of these modules, aimed at providing efficient arithmetic operations for digital systems.

## Features:
- Adders: Various adder architectures implemented.
- Multipliers: Designs for multipliers that meet VLSI constraints.
- Floating Point ALU: Arithmetic Logic Unit supporting floating-point operations.
- Simulation and Synthesis: Modules are tested and synthesized for real-world application.

## Technologies Used:
- Verilog: Primary hardware description language used for module design.
- TCL: Scripting for simulation and automation.
- Stata: Used for data analysis and testing performance metrics.

## Getting Started:
To clone and build the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ali-bahr/VLSI-ALU.git
cd VLSI-ALU
```
**Follow the instructions in the script directory for simulations and synthesis steps.**
